                    <h2>Best Apple Macbook Liquid Damage Repair In Delta</h2>
                    <p>The worst kind of damage to any computer is a liquid spill. If you have spilled liquid and have been told it is unfixable or it costs too much money, we got your covered. Donâ€™t use a hair dryer or dump it in a box full of rice to dry
                        it out. Liquid damage should be dealt with immediately to improve the chances of restoring your device. </p>
                    <p>Whatever you do, do not turn it ON. Applying power may cause irreversible damage to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard" target="_blank"><span class="textt"> logic board </span></a> . There are a lot of integrated circuits, capacitors,
                        and coils regulating the power to different components on a logic board. Each component requires a different range of voltage to operate ranging from 1.5 volts to 20+ volts. This is where we offer our experience and expertise and
                        we specialize in liquid damage repairs. </p>
