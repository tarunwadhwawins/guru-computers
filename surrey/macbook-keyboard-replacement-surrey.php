                    <h2>apple macbook keyboard replacement surrey</h2>
                    <p> Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro/" target="_blank"><span class="textt">MacBook </span></a> is designed with great quality keyboard however, sometimes a liquid spill can cause damage and leave it completely unusable or partially
                        usable. A
                        <a href="macbook-liquid-damage-repair-surrey"><span class="textt">liquid spill </span></a> can also cause damage if it penetrates to the MacBook logic board so it must be cleaned immediately. Besides liquid damage, our little
                        ones can rip some keys apart. Those tiny keys are very hard to put back and would require a complete keyboard replacement.</p>
                    <p> At Guru Computers, we replace a lot of keyboards and we have OEM keyboards in stock. Most keyboard replacements cost less than $200 except a few higher end retina models which require a battery to be taken apart. For an exact quote,
                        please bring the device to the store or call one of our experts with a model no and a serial no of the device.</p>
