                    <h2>Apple Macbook Liquid Damage Repair Surrey</h2>
                    <p> Liquid damage is the worst damage to any electronic device. If you have spilled liquid donâ€™t use a hair dryer or dump your device in a box full of rice to dry it out. Liquid damage must be cleaned immediately at a component level to
                        improve the chances of restoring your device. Do not try to turn it ON.</p>
                    <p> Applying power may cause irreversible damage to the logic board. There are a lot of integrated circuits, capacitors, and coils regulating the power to different components on a logic board. If you have been told it is unfixable or
                        it costs too much money, we got you covered.</p>
