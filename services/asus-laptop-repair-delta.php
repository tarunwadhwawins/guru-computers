                        <p>ASUS has built a solid reputation among leading laptop and desktop brands. Asus offers an affordable and durable line of VivoBook and the premium line ASUS ZenBook.</p>
                        <h2>Asus Repair Delta – Asus Laptop Services</h2>

                        <h2>Asus Laptop Screen Repair – Asus Repair Delta</h2>
                        <p>
                            The high-resolution screen on these laptops are susceptible to cracks and shatters in case of an accidental drop. At Guru Computers, we stock the OEM screens for a quick and affordable LCD screen replacement. Our trained technicians can assess the damage
                            and replace the screen to restore your Asus VivoBook or Asus Zen book to its original condition. Once the screen has replaced, it will work just like you got it new. This service has backed by 90-days no hassle warranty.</p>
                        <h2>Asus Laptop Hard Drive Upgrade</h2>
                        <p>A common problem with mid-range laptops is the sluggish performance due to traditional hard drives wearing out. Those spindles and heads cause slowness of the disks and eventually, the hard drive fails due to malfunction. At Guru
                            Computers we can replace the traditional hard drive with a Solid-State Drive which not only improves the speed by 10 times but, also improves battery performance. These services are backed by a 90-days no hassle warranty.</p>
                        <h2>Asus Laptop Ram Upgrade</h2>
                        <p>Is your computer/laptop slow when you load multiple applications at the same time? If it is taking forever to load applications that is possibly due to lack of memory. We highly recommend a memory upgrade for the computer to perform
                            at an optimum level. At Guru Computers, we have memory in stock, and we can offer on the spot upgrade. The price varies with the brand and the amount of RAM you need to upgrade. Please bring in your device for a quick assessment
                            and a quote.</p>
                        <h2>Asus Keyboard Replacement Delta </h2>
                        <p>If you have non-working keys on your keyboard or you have a liquid spillage on your keyboard, you may require a keyboard replacement. Bring it in at our store on Scott road and Delta for a quick assessment and a quote. We are fully

                        <h2>Asus No Power Repair Delta</h2>
                        <p>
                            Your Asus VivoBook or Asus ZenBook may not power ON or charge the battery due to a failing battery or a bad charging port. Worry not as we can help you fix that. Simply bring your Asus laptop at our store on Scott road and Delta for a quick assessment

                        <h2>Asus Liquid Damage Repair
                        </h2>
                        <p>If your Asus laptop has exposed to liquid, please get it to repair as quickly as possible. Liquid residue can cause a lot of damage to the electronic components on the motherboard. You may be tempted to turn it ON and use it but,
                            that may result in irreparable damage to your Asus laptop. At Guru Computers, we carry Industry-standard equipment to fully clean your Asus laptop and ensure that it is working as normal. In an unfortunate event where the laptop
                            is not repairable, we always help you recover your data.
