                        <p>Virus, spyware, malware or adware, mostly spread via email attachments and therefore, you must take precaution in opening such attachments unless you know the legitimacy of the source of that message.</p>
                        <p>Viruses can be in the form of attachments with funny images, video files, links for online sales, etc. Computer viruses also spread heavily through downloads from the Internet. They can easily hide in pirated software or in files
                            or utilities that you might download.</p>
