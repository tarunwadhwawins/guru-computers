                            <ul>
                                <li>Your computer has dropped while it is running causing a shock to the hard drive.</li>
                                <li>The electric motor fails which allows the platter to spin</li>
                                <li>Excessive heating causes the electronic circuit board to fail</li>
                                <li>There are lots of interrupted shutdowns or reboots due to power failure while the disk is writing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>If the hard disk has S.M.A.R.T. technology (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), log files can be checked to identify the probability of failure in the future. S.M.A.R.T. monitors a wide range of hard disk symptoms
                            and logs the condition of the disk at each interruption. It aims to provide a predictable failure date for the disk.</p>
