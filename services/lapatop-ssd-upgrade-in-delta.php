                    <p>Let’s face it. Everyone needs a dependable computer to complete their assignments, reports, presentations and in many cases, their school work. A fast and steady computer makes your life so easy. However, if you have a slow-running
                        computer or a laptop, the regular task takes way longer to complete and results in inefficiency. </p>

                    <p>No one likes to use a slow laptop and delays in meeting their deadlines. Many times these slow performances are a result of a traditional hard drive that is mechanical and doesn’t have a long life. After just 1-2 years, the computer
                        runs very slow making it difficult to complete your job. Often customers will just go buy a new laptop and it’s the same slowness after some time.</p>
                    <h2>flash storage and ssds</h2>
                    <p>SSDs, like USB sticks and smartphones, are typically made with flash (also known as NAND storage). The type and configuration of flash storage are determined by the use case. </p>
                    <p>Flash-based SSDs are becoming more prevalent in current PCs, despite being far more expensive than mechanical hard disc equivalents for a long time. On a little memory card or USB stick, this isn’t as important. When it comes to 512GB
                        of storage, though, the disparity becomes much larger.</p>
                    <p>Flash-SSDs is still the more expensive alternative, but costs have now stabilized to the point where they are not absolutely beyond reach for the average customer looking for a new laptop (or wanting a <b>laptop SSD upgrade</b> ).
                        Simultaneously, SSD lifespan has improved, while it still falls short of hard discs for archival reasons.</p>
