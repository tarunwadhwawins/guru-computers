                    <p>Looking for iMac repair Delta? At Guru Computers, we repair all iMac generations. Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" target="_blank"><span class="textt">iMac </span></a>is a very well-built machine. It’s a marvel of technology inside a solid aluminium chassis with
                        a sleek and elegant design. It has almost all the things you need to in a power machine. However, the parts inside may require repairs occasionally. </p>
                    <p>Especially, the fan and traditional hard drives tend to fail after good use. At times, these units stop working due to a short in the power supply. The repairs are expensive because of the design, and some models are not even designed
                        to be opened and repaired.</p>
